Here’s a clean, professional README for your **Second Brain** project that you can directly use for GitHub:

# 📚 Second Brain

Second Brain is a **personal knowledge management system** built with the MERN stack (React + Express + MongoDB) that allows users to store links (YouTube, Twitter, articles, etc.) and search through them intelligently using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** AI.

It works like a personal brain for your links — store, organize, and retrieve information with AI-powered search.

## 🚀 Features

* **Link Storage** — Save and organize URLs with title, description, tags, and notes.
* **AI-Powered Search** — Search stored links intelligently using RAG AI.
* **Tagging** — Organize links using customizable tags.
* **User Authentication** — Secure login and registration.
* **Responsive UI** — Built with React for smooth user experience.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
* **Database**: MongoDB
* **AI Search**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integration
* **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

## ⚙️ Installation

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Set up environment variables in .env
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. User saves links via the UI.
2. Backend stores links in MongoDB with metadata and indexes them for AI search.
3. User can search links via natural language queries.
4. RAG AI retrieves relevant links and displays them.

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add **bulk import** for links.
* Improve search accuracy with fine-tuned embeddings.
* Add browser extension for quick link saving.
* Enable offline mode with local storage.
